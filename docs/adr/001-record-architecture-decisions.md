## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architectural Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

Introduces an additional burden on core project maintainers to diligently follow architecture discussions and record the
results in this repo as an ADR.
