# ADR 001 - Record architectural decisions

Date: 26-11-2024

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. Architectural Decision Records as
[described by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) provides a
framework for writing down these decisions.

## Decision

We will use Architectural Decision Records.

## Consequences

Introduces an additional burden on core project maintainers to diligently follow architecture discussions and record the
results in this repo as an ADR.
